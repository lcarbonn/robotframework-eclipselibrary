= Eclipse Library concepts =

Robotframework Eclipse Library is based on [http://www.eclipse.org/swtbot/ SWTBot tool].

== Eclipse Library Mechanism ==
 * Eclipse Library call SWTBot thru java reflexion API.
 * The Eclipse Library plugin make the interface between Eclipse Library and its keywords and the Eclipse internal SWTBot plugin.

== Using Eclipse Library keywords on widgets ==
 * Eclipse Library manage a widget context.
 ** Only one widget is present in the context at one time.
 ** That means, you should put a widget into the context before calling methods on it.
 ** All keywords begining with "Find" will put the retieved widget in the context.
 ** Then you can call widget specific keywords on it.

== Time Format == 
EclipseLibrary use the same format of time than [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.5.4/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#time-format RobotFramework]

Example : 1d 2h 3m 4s 5ms

== Eclipse Library limitations ==
 * Eclipse Library uses _at the moment_ only standards eclipse components and SWT widgets.
 * It interacts with simple SWTBot widget finders and actions
 * Snapshots are now working (since v0.4)
 * All direct SWT classes actions are not yet implemented (except SWT colors)
 * keyboard shorcuts keywords and keyboard layout are not yet implemented
